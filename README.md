1, we used regression models to predict the density of the cores

2, we used a classification model to determine the binding site of the protein that will be TAF15.

Other files on this home page contain notes from my time learning python, linux, and deep learning in python. (including an introduction to the basics, working environment configuration, and training projects). This will prove that I am competent enough to apply deep learning knowledge to my research work. Since some of the material is part of the company I work for, it is not publicly available. 

# Project record of applying machine learning in R

[Git hub link](https://github.com/JoneSu1/R-based-machine-learning-projects/tree/master)

This is a selection of reports and code from my past work that can be made publicly available, which will demonstrate my extensive experience in machine learning and processing of large sample sizes of genetic data.

The analyses included in these 4 machine learning projects: ANOVA, WGCNA analysis, GO/KEGG enrichment analysis, GSVA analysis, correlation expression analysis, ROC diagnostic curve, Lasso regression analysis, XGbost analysis, random forest, single-factor COX, multi-factor COX, random vector machine SVM analysis, K-M survival analysis, etc..
