# Convolutional Neural Networks: Application

Welcome to Course 4's second assignment! In this notebook, you will:

- Create a mood classifer using the TF Keras Sequential API
- Build a ConvNet to identify sign language digits using the TF Keras Functional API

**After this assignment you will be able to:**

- Build and train a ConvNet in TensorFlow for a __binary__ classification problem
- Build and train a ConvNet in TensorFlow for a __multiclass__ classification problem
- Explain different use cases for the Sequential and Functional APIs

To complete this assignment, you should already be familiar with TensorFlow. If you are not,
please refer back to the **TensorFlow Tutorial** of the third week of Course 2 
("**Improving deep neural networks**").
