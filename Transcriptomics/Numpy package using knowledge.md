**Introduce**

    #Numpy, short for Numerical python, is the most important basic package for numerical computation in Python today.

    One of the core features of Numpy is the N-dimensional array object (ndarray). nadarry is a fast, flexible container for large data in Python.
    Arrays run mathematical operations on blocks using a scalar-like operation syntax.
    

**Input NumPy**

    #Code
    import numpy as np #the np means numpy, we give a short for numpy.
